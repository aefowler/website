#### Diet, Immunity, & Gut Microbes in Bees

For my dissertation, I studied the effects of diet and gut microbes on pathogen infections in bees. My first chapter was a [review paper](https://portlandpress.com/emergtoplifesci/article-abstract/4/1/59/221505/Parasite-defense-mechanisms-in-bees-behavior) summarizing our current understanding of how bees defend themselves against pathogens and the role that diet and gut microbes have on immunity and infection outcomes.

Much of my PhD work stemmed from the finding that pollen from sunflowers and goldenrod (Family: Asteraceae) reduces a gut pathogen in bumble bees ([Giacomini et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32681-y?ref=marketbulletin), [LoCascio et al., 2019](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.190279)). In collaboration with the [Sadd Lab](https://about.illinoisstate.edu/bmsadd/), I investigated how a sunflower pollen diet impacts the bumble bee immune system as a potential mechanism of the reduced infection. We found that consuming sunflower pollen did not significantly affect activity of the immune enzyme phenoloxidase or hemolymph antibacterial activity. You can read more in our recent paper: [Fowler et al., 2022, *Philosophical Transactions B*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2021.0160). 

In addition, I am interested in how diet quality and diversity impact pathogen resistance via changes in the gut microbiome. In collaboration with the [McFrederick Lab](https://melittology.ucr.edu/), I am investigating how a diet of sunflower pollen and parasite infection affects bacterial communities within the gut. These two projects are funded by the USDA National Institute of Food & Agriculture.

#### Social Behavior
 
I am also interested in the evolution of social behavior and the costs and benefits associated with group living, particularly in the context of parasite transmission and the evolution of host defense. As part of my dissertation, I tested the effect of pollen diet on gut microbial communities in social (bumble bees) and solitary bees (leafcutter bees). I am comparing patterns to better understand how the adoption of sociality has impacted microbial symbionts. This project is funded by a Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education graduate student grant.
