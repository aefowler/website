I am originally from Northern Virginia and received my Bachelor's degrees in Plant Biology and Biological Oceanography from NC State University, where I was mentored by many great scientists, including Drs. [Astrid Schnetzer](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/schnetzerlab/home), [Gabrielle Corradino](https://www.instagram.com/marchoftheplankton/), [Brian Langerhans](http://gambusia.zo.ncsu.edu/index.html), and [Becky Irwin](https://irwinlab.weebly.com/), who inspired me to pursue science. I'm currently pursuing my PhD with [Dr. Lynn Adler](https://blogs.umass.edu/lynnadler/) at UMass Amherst. I enjoy being in nature, growing plants, and biking.
