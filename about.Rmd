I am a PhD candidate in the Adler Lab at UMass Amherst where I study the ecology and evolution of species interactions. I am particularly fond of plants, insects, and microbes. I am originally from Northern Virginia and received my Bachelor's degrees in Plant Biology and Biological Oceanography from NC State University, where I was mentored by many great scientists, including Drs. [Astrid Schnetzer](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/schnetzerlab/home), [Brian Langerhans](http://gambusia.zo.ncsu.edu/index.html), and [Becky Irwin](https://irwinlab.weebly.com/), who inspired me to pursue science as a career. <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy being in nature and growing plants. I'm usually toggling between various hobbies; lately I've been throwing clay and fermenting foods. <br/>
