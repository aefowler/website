I am originally from Northern Virginia and received my Bachelor's degrees <img src="images/IMG_5006.JPG" width="29%" ALIGN="right"> in Plant Biology and Biological Oceanography from NC State University, where I was mentored by many great scientists, including Drs. [Astrid Schnetzer](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/schnetzerlab/home), [Brian Langerhans](http://gambusia.zo.ncsu.edu/index.html), and [Becky Irwin](https://irwinlab.weebly.com/). In February 2023, I received my PhD in [Organismic & Evolutionary Biology](https://gpls.cns.umass.edu/oeb) with [Dr. Lynn Adler](https://blogs.umass.edu/lynnadler/) at UMass Amherst.
