### Welcome! 
</center>

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Smithsonian National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation), advised by Drs. [Robert Fleischer](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/about/staff/robert-c-fleischer) and [Terry Chesser](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/terry-chesser). I recently completed my PhD, advised by [Dr. Lynn Adler](https://blogs.umass.edu/lynnadler/), in the [Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://gpls.cns.umass.edu/oeb) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

I'm interested in the ecology and evolution of species interactions. My work is motivated by the critical need to conserve of biodiversity, with a focus on species that provide essential ecosystem services, such as pollinators and seed dispersers. On this site, you can find more information about my research and outreach activities.
