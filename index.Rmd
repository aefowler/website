#### Welcome! 
My name is Alison, I am a PhD candidate and NSF Fellow in the [Adler Lab](https://blogs.umass.edu/lynnadler/) and the [Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://gpls.cns.umass.edu/oeb) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm interested in the ecology and evolution of species interactions, specifically those of plants, pollinators, and microbes.
