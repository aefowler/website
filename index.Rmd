### Welcome! 
</center>

I recently completed my PhD in the [Adler Lab](https://blogs.umass.edu/lynnadler/) and the [Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://gpls.cns.umass.edu/oeb) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm interested in the ecology and evolution of species interactions. My work is motivated by the critical need to conserve of biodiversity, with a focus on species that provide essential ecosystem functions, such as pollinators and seed dispersers. On this site, you can find more information about my research and outreach activities.
