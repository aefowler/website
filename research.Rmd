#### I am interested in the ecology and evolution of plant-animal-microbe interactions, ranging from parasitism to mutualisms. 

##### Dissertation Research: 

Pollinators are essential for ecosystem health, but many species are experiencing population declines. My dissertation research focused on bees and their interactions with dietary host plants, pathogens (primarily *Crithidia bombi*), and gut bacteria. You can learn more about these projects [here](diss_1.html). I hope my research improves our understanding of factors that influence bee health as well as supports sustainable food production and the livelihoods of farmers. </br>

##### Current Postdoc Research: 

My postdoc research at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute focuses on the gut microbiome of yellow-rumped warblers and other songbirds to better understand the role of gut microbes in their digestion of waxy berries. Below is a poster that summarizes our questions and hypotheses.

I am also a budding data scientist and excited about writing and sharing code for data processing, visualization, and analysis. [Here is a list of data science resources](datasci.html) that I find helpful. 

**Images of pollinators at top of page.** From left to right: a queen bumble bee (*Bombus sp.*) foraging on *Cordyalis caseana* in the Colorado Rockies; a small carpenter bee (*Ceratina sp.*) on a strawflower (*Xerochrysum bracteatum*) at The Bars Farm in Deerfield, Massachusetts; a worker bumble bee (*Bombus impatiens*) foraging and packing pollen from a sunflower (*Helianthus annuus*) at the UMass permaculture garden on campus; and a golden digger wasp (*Sphex ichneumoneus*) departing from cockscomb (*Celosia argentea*) in Raleigh, North Carolina.
